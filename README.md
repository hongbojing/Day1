# Day1
Day1 of hongbojing_365

###I read an article yesterday about a web developer lagendary experience from [here](http://jenniferdewalt.com/)
#####She developed 1 web page per day during a peroid of 180 days, I clicked each page and was impressed, this person is the ideal person to learn coding because she learned by doing, being inspired, I decided to create a new project called 'hongbojing_365', which means that I would create 365 web pages in the next 365 days, and today is the Day1.

###I do not want to copy everything she did, I just like the idea of starting from small, there will be a blog to record this process, let's do it.

#Day 1 project: 
>##*Google searching result style resume
######I got this idea from a creative resume style website, which I already forgot, anyway, I would create a one-page resume which looks like the searching result you got from Google, of course please feel free to download it and edit with your information.
